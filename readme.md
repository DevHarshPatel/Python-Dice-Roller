This project is a python based Dice rolling simulator

The project is SIMPLE, FUN, INTERESTING

It uses the following PYTHON concepts:
  Randomising
  While loops
  For loop
  Input
  ASCII art(not particularly a python concept)
  Conditional Statements

It first ask for the number of rolls of the dice you want .

Then it randomises between 1-6 and then prints that dice's ASCII art for the targeted times.(For this instance our User wants to do 3 different dice rolls. )
